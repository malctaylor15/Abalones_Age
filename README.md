# Abalones_Age

In this notebook we will be looking at abalones data set from UCI
The dataset and description can be found here. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone
The goal is to predict which age category an observation belongs to based on the information given. 
 We conduct some exploratory data analysis with visualizations. 
 
 Next we use K Nearest Neighbors and 1 v all logistic regression to predict the age group. 


There are 4177 observations with 7 given variables. The age can be determined by the number of Rings. 
We can roughly classify the age into young (1-9 Rings), medium (9, 10 Rings) and old (10+ Rings).
